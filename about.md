title: "About SIGCPP"
---

SIGCPP is the Special Interest Group on C++. The primary goal of the SIG is to learn**,** teach, and practice software design and implementation in C++. It is a place for students, teachers, and practitioners to freely discuss, present, write, and practice all things C++. 

Although activities focus on C++, much of the material should translate to comparable languages such as Java and C\#.

SIGCPP was formed by [Sean Murthy](https://github.com/smurthys) in May 2018.

### **Activities**

Typical activities include discussions, presentations, technical writing \(blog posts and the like\), and implementation. Most implementation is done using sound software-engineering principles of design, testing, documentation, and version control. 

Most work products are hosted on GitHub and distributed free of cost for non-commercial use. The exact license can vary across work products, but CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 and MIT License are common models. 

### **Membership**

The SIG is meant for anyone who consistently demonstrates genuine alignment with the SIG's mission. Anyone interested in C++ is welcome to join. Students and faculty members \(from any university, anywhere in the world\) are especially welcome.

There is no cost to join the SIG. Moderators review membership inquiries and accept members based on the potential contribution the prospect and the SIG can make to each other.

**Note:** In general, SIGCPP is **not** a place to learn basic C++ syntax and concepts. By basic syntax and concepts we mean material that is learned in a first academic course on C++. The pre-requisite knowledge does not have to come from a university course.

### **Code of Conduct**

All members are expected to consistently and actively participate in the SIG's activities; freely share ideas, code, and knowledge with all members; and otherwise interact with all members in a manner that is consistent with the SIG's mission.

Members are expected to provide constructive feedback. They should also be willing to both receive and apply feedback. All interactions should foster learning.

Moderators attempt to work with lurkers to get them to actively participate in the SIG's activities. Habitually inactive members will quite likely lose membership.

### **Meetings**

Most discussions and presentations are on **Microsoft Teams**. Meetings are scheduled as necessary, one meeting at a time. Meetings typically last 1-2 hours with the goal of making each meeting long enough to be productive. Outside scheduled meetings, members are encouraged to freely interact with and learn from each other.

Meeting attendees are encouraged to participate from a computer \(instead of a mobile device\). Participation by video is encouraged, but video is not always required. All attendees should be willing to share their screen during the meeting.

Attendees should be able to edit and run C++ programs, browse web pages, and read documentation on their own computer during meetings. They may use any local/online C++ environment that supports at least C++ 17. Members frequently use GCC and Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.
