This is Part 2 of a 3-part series on `std::string_view`. This part focuses on the safety
`std::string_view` provides over character arrays, and on the safety considerations to be
made when using `std::string_view`.

[Part 1]( {{ '/2020/04/03/efficiently-processing-immutable-text' | relative_url }} )
focuses on efficiency of `std::string_view` over `std::string`. Part 3 provides guidelines
on using `std::string_view`.

### 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; String_view creation means

As stated in [Part 1]( {{ '/2020/04/03/efficiently-processing-immutable-text#1' | relative_url }} )
of this series, [`std::string_view`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view)
is simply a read-only wrapper around a character array. This statement is true regardless
of the creation means used: from nothing, from a [C-string]( {{ '/2020/03/30/exploring-c-strings' | relative_url }} ),
from a character array that is not a C-string, or from a [`std::string`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string)
object.

Listing A shows creation of four string_view objects, each using a different creation
means. The object created from nothing (variable `sv1`) is effectively as if it is
created from the empty C-string `""`.

**Note:** Internally, a string_view created from nothing is **not** the same as a
string_view created from an empty C-string [[string.view.cons](https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4659/string.view#cons)].

##### Listing A: creating string_view objects using four different means

```cpp
std::string_view sv1;          // from nothing: approximates std::string_view sv1("");

std::string_view sv2{"hello"}; // from C-string

char a[]{'h','e','l','l','o'};
std::string_view sv3{a, 5};    // from character array that is not a C-string

std::string s{"hello"};
std::string_view sv4{s};       // from string: approx std::string_view sv4{s.c_str()};
```

---

A string_view created from a string object is the same as a string_view created using the
C-string obtained via the [`c_str`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/c_str)
function on the string object. That is, the code associated with variable `sv4` could be
rewritten as: `std::string_view sv4{s.c_str()};`

**Note:** As discussed in [Part 1]( {{ '/2020/04/03/efficiently-processing-immutable-text#1' | relative_url }} ),
creating a string_view from a string object actually invokes an operator function in
`std::string`.

### 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Simplicity and safety over character arrays

It is much cleaner and safer to use the string_view wrapper instead of directly using a
character array because string_view has functions and operators that abstract over
low-level C-style functions. For example, we could simply test if `sv1 > sv2`, instead of
testing if `std::strcmp(z1, z2) > 0`, where `z1` and `z2` represent C-strings, and sv1
and sv2 are corresponding string_view objects. Likewise, we can use the function member
`find` instead of the low-level functions `std::strchr`, and `std::strstr`. (The
string_view function `find` can find both single-character and multi-character texts.)

The string_view approach also has the advantage that it works with any character array,
not just with C-strings. As a result, there is no need to resort to using functions such
as `std::memcmp` to compare arrays and `std::memchr` to locate a character. Plus, with
string_view, there is no need to explicitly carry around the size of every character
array.

Also, because a string_view is immutable by design, it eliminates the many `const`
qualifications that would be necessary to guarantee immutability of character arrays.

Lastly, the string_view approach is safer because the programmer does not have to worry
about buffer overflow and other issues associated with low-level functions such as
`std::strcmp` and `std::strchr`.

### 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside a string_view

As stated in [Part 1]( {{ '/2020/04/03/efficiently-processing-immutable-text#4' | relative_url }} ),
just two internal data members facilitate the entire string_view functionality:

- `data_`: a pointer to the first character of the array wrapped
- `size_`: the number of characters of interest in the array

Using just these two data members, a string_view is able to become a wrapper to a
character array regardless of the creation means used: In all four creation means shown
in Listing A, the internal member `data_` points to the first character in the array
wrapped, and the `size_` member contains the number of characters of interest.

String_view function members [`data`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view/data)
and [`size`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view/size) provide
access to the internal data members `data_` and `size_` respectively.

**Note:** It is important to understand how a string_view is able to wrap any character
array using just the aforementioned data members. I recommend studying [this program](https://godbolt.org/z/jh3qPR)
prepared to illustrate the effect of different creation means on the internals of a string_view object.

### 4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Safety issues with string_view

There are three major safety-related issues when using string_views:

- assuming a string_view object makes a copy of the character array it wraps;
- having a string_view object outlive the character array it wraps; and
- assuming the `data` function member always returns a C-string.

String_view does **not** make a copy of the character array it wraps; nor does it own the
array. Instead, the string_view object's creator continues to own the character array and
is responsible for the array's management. Specifically, after a string_view object has
served its purpose, the object owner should deallocate the array if the array was
dynamically allocated.

The bottom line is that a string_view object should **never** outlive the character array
it wraps. For example, a function should **not** return a string_view object that wraps a
local array. Listing B shows examples of acceptable and unacceptable uses of
string_view. The comments in the code are self-explanatory.

**Note:** Carefully study the differences between functions `bad_idea` and
`also_acceptable` in Listing B.

{% include bookmark.html id="Listing B" %}

##### Listing B: examples of acceptable and unacceptable uses of string_view

```cpp
std::string_view bad_idea() {
    char z[]{"hello"};          // z is deallocated when this function ends
    return std::string_view{z}; // bad: returned object wraps deallocated array
}

std::string_view another_bad_idea() {
    std::string s{"hello"};     // s is deleted when this function ends
    return std::string_view{s}; // bad: returned obj wraps data in deleted string
}

std::string_view also_bad_idea() {
    char* p = new char[6]{};
    std::string_view sv{p};     // sv wraps dynamically allocated array
    delete[] p;                 // sv still wraps deallocated array
    return sv;                  // bad: returned object wraps deallocated array
}

void possibly_acceptable(std::string_view& sv) {
    std::cout << sv;            // safe only if sv wraps a legit array
}

void acceptable() {
    char z[]{"hello"};          // z is deallocated when this function ends
    std::string_view sv{z};
    possibly_acceptable(sv);    // OK: z lives until end of this function
}

std::string_view also_acceptable() {
    return std::string_view{"hello"}; // OK: "hello" has static storage
}
```

---

Another issue to be aware of when using string_view is that the function member `data` is
not guaranteed to return a C-string. Specifically, that function simply returns a pointer
to the first character in the array that was passed to it. (It could return a pointer to
a later character in the array if the function [`remove_prefix`]( {{ '/2020/04/03/efficiently-processing-immutable-text#4' | relative_url }} )
was called earlier.)

Listing C illustrates safe and unsafe uses of the `data` function member. Part 3 discusses
the details, but briefly, it is better to avoid accessing the `data` function altogether.
For example, insert a string_view directly to an output stream (as is done with `sv6` in
the last line of Listing C) instead of inserting the value returned from the `data`
function.

##### Listing C: safe and unsafe uses of `data` function member

```cpp
char z[]{"hello"};          // z is a C-string
std::string_view sv5{z};
std::cout << sv5.data();    // OK: sv5 wraps a C-string

char a[]{'h','e'};          // a is not a C-string
std::string_view sv6{a,2};
std::cout << sv6.data();    // unsafe: sv6 does not wrap a C-string

std::cout << sv6;           // OK: insertion operator is safely overloaded
```

### 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Part-2 summary

Overall, `std::string_view` provides a cleaner and safer means to process immutable data
than character arrays do. However, there are some safety concerns in using string_view,
especially concerns related to object lifetime.

Listing D shows two versions of a function to count vowels in some text. The first
version represents text as a C-string; the second represents text as a string_view. The listing aptly demonstrates that the string_view version is both simpler and safer:

- No pointers

- No need for `const` qualification: the C-string version **needs** `const`
  qualification; the string_view version does not need it, but that qualification is
  made as good practice. (In this case, there is a benefit to `const` qualifying the
  string_view objects. What is that benefit?)

- Simpler code: the for-loop header and the test for vowel are both easier to
  comprehend (and thus to maintain) in the string_view version.

- No undefined behavior: the C-string version has undefined behavior if the null
  character is missing. (This issue exists in two locations in the C-string version.
  What are those locations?)

**Note:** Be sure to read Part 3 of this series where I provide some guidelines on using
string_view. (I will add the link here when Part 3 is published.)

##### Listing D: counting vowels using C-string and string_view ([run this code](https://godbolt.org/z/BVLL2P))

```cpp
// using C-string
std::size_t vowel_count(const char* z) {
    const char vowels[]{"aeiouAEIOU"};

    std::size_t count{0};
    for (std::size_t i = 0; z[i] != '\0'; ++i)
        if (std::strchr(vowels, z[i]) != nullptr)
            ++count;

    return count;
}

// using std::string_view
std::size_t vowel_count(const std::string_view& sv) {
    const std::string_view vowels{"aeiouAEIOU"};

    std::size_t count{0};
    for (auto c : sv)
        if (vowels.find(c) != std::string_view::npos)
            ++count;

    return count;
}
```

### 6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Exercises

{% include bookmark.html id="6.1" %}

1. Answer the questions embedded in the bulleted list in the summary section.

{% include bookmark.html id="6.2" %}

2. Which of the two versions of function `vowel_count` in Listing D is faster? Which
   version is likely to use more run-time memory? Why?

   - Use the code in [Listing A of Part 1]( {{ '/2020/04/03/efficiently-processing-immutable-text#listing-a' | relative_url }} )
     as a model to measure wall times.

{% include bookmark.html id="6.3" %}

3. Which of the two versions `vowel_count` is better to count vowels in a character
   array that is not null-terminated? Why?

{% include bookmark.html id="6.4" %}

4. Using only the string_view version of `vowel_count`, write a `main` function to count
   vowels in a C-string and a character array that is not null-terminated. That is, make
   two calls to the string_view version of `vowel_count`, each time with a different
   argument. (For this part of the exercise, it might help to remove the C-string
   version of `vowel_count` from the program.)

{% include bookmark.html id="6.5" %}

5. Assuming the string_view abstraction (or something comparable) does not exist or
   cannot be used, write a function or functions to count vowels in a character array
   that may or may not be null-terminated.

   It is OK to have two versions of the function if that approach seems better. (Listing D already shows the C-string version.) However, strive to reuse code as much as
   possible, but also strive to make code maintainable and "efficient". Include comments
   that clearly explain the rationale for your choices.

{% include bookmark.html id="6.6" %}

6. Rewrite the string_view version of `vowel_count` using member function
   [`remove_prefix`]( {{ '/2020/04/03/efficiently-processing-immutable-text#4' | relative_url }} ).
   There are three different approaches to this rewrite. Try all three approaches and
   outline the pros and cons of each approach. State which approach you prefer and
   include a rationale.

{% include bookmark.html id="6.7" %}

7. Rewrite the string_view version of `vowel_count` using member function
   [`find_first_of`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view/find_first_of).
   Which version is "better": the one in Listing D, or the rewritten one? Why?

{% include bookmark.html id="6.8" %}

8. Write a C-string version of the code in [Listing B of Part 1]( {{ '/2020/04/03/efficiently-processing-immutable-text#listing-b' | relative_url }} ).

{% include bookmark.html id="6.9" %}

9. Write a program to extract words from text, where words may be separated by space,
   comma, semi-colon, or period. Write both a C-string version and a string_view version.

   - Do **not** use regular-expression, stream extraction, or other such approach that
     simplifies the task, but feel free to use any other standard-library facility.

   - Break down the code into appropriate functions.

   - `const` qualify all variables/parameters that represent immutable text. Meeting this
     requirement is quite important for this exercise.

   - Hard-code the following immutable text in the program and use it in testing. Just
     for this exercise, do **not** read the text to process as user input at run time:

     `The quality mantra: improve the process; the process improves you.`

   - Depending on the approach taken in the C-string version, hard-coding the text to
     process as a `const` qualified variable/parameter could pose a challenge. Yet,
     use a `const` qualified variable/parameter to represent the text to process exactly
     as required in the preceding bullet.
