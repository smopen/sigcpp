{% comment %}
    designed for inclusion just before the heading text in a markdown file
    to associate a custom id with heading. Example uses follow:

    {% include bookmark.html id="7" %}

    {% include bookmark.html id="Listing A" %}

    explicitly close empty div so that what follows does not become a
    child of div: using the short-hand for empty element causes the
    div to become a container (not sure why)
{% endcomment %}
<div class="bookmark" id="{{- include.id | slugify: "pretty" -}}"></div>
